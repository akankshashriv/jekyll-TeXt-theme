In this series of posts, I will explore the theory and applications of machine learning from a historical lens. I have often found myself intrigued by how the current state-of-the-art algorithms came to be and how the field evolved. It's a good idea to understand the evolution of a field in order to develop a solid theoretical foundation.

This series focuses on the timeline of Machine Learning up to the decade 2010s - primary contributions and seminal papers that have given us algorithms like Regression, Decision trees, and Neural Networks.

The idea is simple! Imagine this timeline as a graph with a root node as "Statistics". Statistics led to Regression, Bayesian ML and, over time, Deep Learning. We will traverse this graph and learn the math.

## Contents
1. The very beginning - 1950s
2. 1960s - The Bayesian Era
3. The AI Winter of 1970s
4. 1980s see a resurgence
5. 1990s - Beginning of Big Data
6. 2000s - 
7. 2010s
