In this series of posts, I will explore the theory and applications of machine learning from a historical lens. I have often found myself intrigued by how the current state-of-the-art algorithms came to be and how the field evolved. It's a good idea to understand the evolution of a field in order to develop a solid theoretical foundation.

This series focuses on the timeline of Machine Learning up to the decade 2010s - primary contributions and seminal papers that have given us algorithms like Regression, Decision trees, and Neural Networks.

The idea is simple! Imagine this timeline as a graph with a root node as "Statistics". Statistics led to Regression, Bayesian ML and, over time, Deep Learning. We will traverse this graph and learn the math.

The term "Machine Learning" was famously coined by [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel) in 1959 when he was working on computer checkers at IBM. Although research started in late 1940s, a fully developed framework in learning theory only took shape in 1980s with Valiant's work on PAC model and reinvention of Backpropagation algorithm. So, even though there were some breakthrough between 1950-1970, the field was quite disjointed. Since 1990s, ML emerged as a promising field with commercial applications which has fueled the research even more.
