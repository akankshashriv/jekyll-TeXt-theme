In this series of posts, I will explore the theory and applications of machine learning from a historical lens. I have often found myself intrigued by how the current state-of-the-art algorithms came to be and how the field evolved. It's a good idea to understand the evolution of a field in order to develop a solid theoretical foundation.

This series focuses on the timeline of Machine Learning upto 2010s - primary contributions and seminal papers that have given us algorithms like Regression, Decision trees, and Neural Networks.
