Before the 1950s, we already had the modern binary system, Ada Lovelace's first computer program and Turing's Universal Machine. By 1940s, there already was curiosity in understanding the human brain. Neurophysiologists Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts published their work on "*A Logical Calculus of The Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity*" in 1943 which described the behavior of human neurons in terms of propositional logic and modeled a "neuron net" as electrical circuits. Meanwhile, Alan Turing was working on the concept of what is now widely known as Artificial Intelligence. His [seminal paper](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238) discusses if machines can think and a "Turing test" to determine if that indeed is the case.

With the advent of these questions, 1950s would see the first ever artificial neural network created. But before that, let's look at what tools we already had at hand.
