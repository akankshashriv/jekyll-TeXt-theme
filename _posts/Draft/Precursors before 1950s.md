Before the 1950s, we already had the modern binary system, Ada Lovelace's first computer program and Turing'd Universal Machine. By 1940s, there already was curiosity in understanding the human brain. Neurophysiologists Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts published their work on "*A Logical Calculus of The Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity*" in 1943 which described the behavior of human neurons in terms of propositional logic and modeled a "neuron net" as electrical circuits.
